            <br><br>
            <p>Hip-hop is a style of music that is most frequently recognised by a powerful, rhythmic beat 
            and a rap vocal recording. One of the most popular music genres in the US, the genre got its 
            start in New York City in the 1970s as a cultural interchange between Black, Latino, and 
            Caribbean adolescents. Hip-hop is a culture that is based on four primary tenets: graffiti, 
            breakdancing (also known as breaking or b-boying), rapping (also known as MCing), and DJing.
            Hip-hop has given rise to numerous subgenres since its inception, including trap, grime, 
            gangster rap, rap rock (or nu metal), crunk, chillhop, bounce, mumble rap, Latin hip-hop, 
            and conscious hip-hop. DJ Kool Herc, Tupac Shakur, The Notorious B.I.G., The Roots, Nas, Jay-Z, 
            and others are renowned hip-hop performers.

            <h2 id="history">History of Hip-Hop Music</h2><br>
            <p>Hip-hop's two main historical eras are the old school hip-hop era (1970–1985), which spanned from
            the genre's inception until it entered the mainstream, and the golden age hip-hop era (1985–1993), 
            which combined the sounds of the East Coast and the West Coast and gave way to the modern era with 
            the rise of gangsta rap and G-funk, both of which were developed by the West Coast. </p>
            <br>

            <p>The underground and hardcore hip hop styles, which essentially define the present era, emerged in 
            the years following 1993.At block parties in New York City in the 1970s, DJs started isolating the 
            percussion breaks to hit funk, soul, R&B, and disco tunes. Hip hop was born. These tunes are based on 
            These tunes are based on "breakbeat" DJing. Early hip hop riffs and rhythms were largely inspired by 
            funk music. Speaking over the music was often used in funk, most notably on albums created by George Clinton, 
            and certain funk songs, like James Brown's "Payback" (1974), are plainly forecasting hip hop music. As 
            hip hop gained popularity, artists started talking while the music played; these individuals were referred 
            to as MCs or emcees. The Sugarhill Gang's "Rapper's Delight," which reached the Top 40 on the American 
            Billboard pop singles chart, was one of the first commercially issued hip hop songs to be recorded in 1979. 
            This song is actually credited with coining the term "rapper" for music. Although the Fatback Band were a funk 
            and disco group, some historians consider King Tim III (Personality Jock) by them to be the first hip hop 
            recording to be professionally released.</p><br>

            <p>Hip hop started to branch out and become more complicated in the 1980s. At the exact time, enhanced techniques 
            like electronic recording and scratching were created. Hip-hop gained popularity in the late 1980s, and a variety 
            of new styles and subgenres started to emerge. Hip hop artists joined forces with rock bands and developed conscious 
            hip hop, jazz-rap, and gangsta rap.West Coast gangsta rappers and the resurgent East Coast started a protracted conflict 
            in the 1990s. Both Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. passed away as a result of it, in 1996 and 1997, respectively. 
            With their song "Tha Crossroads," Cleveland-based rap group Bone Thugs-N-Harmony tied The Beatles' 32-year-old record for 
            the fastest-rising single. In 2000, Scottish-American White rap artist Eminem's The Marshall Mathers LP sold over nine 
            million copies and received a Grammy Award.</p><br><br>

            <dl>
                <dt><b>Strong, rhythmic beat</b></dt>
                    <dd>The biggest element that links hip-hop music together is a rhythmic beat. It moves the song along smoothly and provides 
                        a backdrop for the vocal delivery, whether it's quick and forceful or sluggish and laid back. The majority of hip-hop 
                        beats aren't just straightforward drum beats; rather, beat-making is a complex and diversified art form that gives rise 
                        to other songs and sounds.
                    </dd>
                <dt><b>Vocals</b></dt>
                    <dd>
                        Rapping, a rhythmic, typically rhymed sort of chant that interacts with the beat, is the primary vocal style used in the 
                        bulk of hip-hop music. The spoken word, singing, autotune, and ad-libs are further vocal techniques.
                    </dd>
                <dt><b>Breaks</b></dt>
                    <dd>
                        Breaks: The term "break" refers to extended percussion-heavy sections of hip-hop music. DJ Kool Herc is acknowledged with 
                        creating the idea of a break and promoting dancing (also known as "breakdancing," "breaking," or "b-boying") during these 
                        musical measures in the 1970s. Breaks are frequently used in contemporary hip-hop tracks to pay tribute to the genre's 
                        origins or inspire dancing.
