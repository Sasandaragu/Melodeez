            <br><br>
            <p>Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form during the mid-1950s in the United States and the United Kingdom.[4] During the 1950s and 1960s, pop music encompassed rock and roll and the youth-oriented styles it influenced. Rock and pop music remained roughly synonymous until the late 1960s, after which pop became associated with music that was more commercial, ephemeral, and accessible.</p>
<br>
<p>Identifying factors of pop music usually include repeated choruses and hooks, short to medium-length songs written in a basic format (often the verse–chorus structure), and rhythms or tempos that can be easily danced to. Much pop music also borrows elements from other styles such as rock, urban, dance, Latin, and country.</p>
<br>
<p>The terms popular music and pop music are often used interchangeably, although the former more accurately describes all music that is popular and includes many disparate styles. Although much of the music that appears on record charts is considered to be pop music, the genre is distinguished from chart music.</p>

            <h2 id="history">History of Pop Music</h2><br>
            <p>Pop music is a genre that has its origins in the mid-1950s as a direct offshoot of rock and roll. It emerged as a form of accessible and commercially appealing music that catered to a broad audience. The term "pop" is short for "popular," and the genre's main goal is to create music that can resonate with a wide range of people, transcending age, cultural, and language barriers.</p><br>

<p>The roots of pop music can be traced back to the rise of rock and roll in the 1950s. Pioneering artists like Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, and Jerry Lee Lewis brought a fresh and rebellious sound that captivated young audiences. This period marked the fusion of various musical styles, including rhythm and blues, country, and gospel, creating a new and exciting genre.</p><br>

<p>In the 1960s, the British Invasion had a significant impact on the development of pop music. British bands like The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Kinks, and The Who gained global popularity and influenced artists worldwide. During this decade, pop music expanded its reach and diversified into different sub-genres, such as psychedelic pop and sunshine pop.</p><br>

<p>The 1970s witnessed the rise of disco, characterized by its danceable beats and soulful vocals. Disco acts like Donna Summer, Bee Gees, and Chic dominated the charts and club scene, influencing pop music's sound and fashion. Additionally, the 1970s saw the emergence of glam rock, with artists like David Bowie and Queen pushing the boundaries of gender and theatricality in their performances.</p><br>

<p>The 1980s is often referred to as the golden age of pop music. It brought forth the popularity of synth-pop and new wave, incorporating synthesizers and electronic elements. Iconic artists like Madonna, Michael Jackson, Prince, and Whitney Houston achieved massive success, defining the sound of the decade and influencing future generations of pop stars.</p><br>

<p>The 1990s saw the prominence of boy bands and girl groups, with acts like Backstreet Boys, *NSYNC, Spice Girls, and Destiny's Child capturing the hearts of teenage fans worldwide. The era also witnessed the rise of influential solo artists like Mariah Carey and Britney Spears, who solidified their status as pop icons.</p><br>

<p>The early 2000s marked the continuation of solo pop stars' dominance, including Beyoncé, Justin Timberlake, and Rihanna. The decade also saw the fusion of pop with other genres like hip-hop, R&B, and electronic music, leading to innovative and diverse sounds.</p><br>

<p>In the 2010s, pop music continued to evolve, with artists like Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, Bruno Mars, and Ed Sheeran achieving mainstream success. The rise of streaming platforms and social media significantly impacted how pop music is consumed and promoted, giving rise to a new generation of internet-born pop stars.</p><br><br>
