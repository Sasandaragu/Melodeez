            <p>Jazz is America’s classical music. In a four part lecture series, recorded live at the John F. Kennedy 
                Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., Dr. Billy Taylor, noted jazz pianist, historian, 
                and educator, shares glimpses of his extensive knowledge of jazz music from its roots in the African-American
                slavery experience, through the early days of ragtime, and onward through swing, bop, and progressive jazz. 
                Dr. Taylor combines academic research with a wealth of personal knowledge of the music and shares many fascinating
                anecdotes about the great artists of jazz. He cautions, however, that four hours is only long enough to scratch the surface.
                For an in depth look at jazz history, get a copy of “Jazz Piano, A Jazz History.”

            <h2 id="history">History of Jazz Music</h2><br>
            <p>In 1919, one of the most popular blues singers, Bessie Smith, released his first jazz recording. Kid Ory’s Original Creole
                jazz band made tours in Los Angeles and San Francisco, releasing commercial recordings in 1922. This marked them as the first 
                African-American jazz band in New Orleans to record and release music. On the other side of the country, particularly in Chicago, 
                Bix Beiderbecke started The Wolverines in 1924. At the same time, Bill Jonhson joined King Oliver to create their famous duets. 
                They developed what would be known as “hot jazz.” Another important event in the history of jazz was when Louis Armstrong joined 
                the Fletcher Henderson dance band to become their soloist. However, his spell only lasted for a limited time after he left the band 
                in 1925. Armstrong’s unique style gave him massive popularity. After joining the Fletcher Henderson band, however, he experimented 
                with a new style of jazz music. The style focused on soloists and arrangements. What made Armstrong’s solos are the chords. While jazz
                solos often emphasized theme improvisation, his solos included experimental chords. <br><br>
                  
                The Jazz Age also witnessed the recordings of Jelly Roll Morton with the New Orleans Rhythm Kings. At first, it was merely a casual mixed-race 
                collaboration, but later, Jelly went on to form Red Hot Peppers. At that time, white orchestras that played jazz dance music were quite popular, 
                which set up a suitable foundation for Red Hot Peppers’ success. Other notable white orchestras included Paul Whiteman’s orchestra and Jean Goldkette’s 
                orchestra.Whiteman, in particular, was one of the most popular bandleaders in the country. He was widely known for domesticating and reviving an inchoate
                type of music. In 1924, he was the man behind the commission of Gershwin’s Rhapsody in Blue. His orchestra also premiered the musical composition that 
                many writers consider the ideal form of the youthful zeitgeist of that era in the history of jazz. There were other notable orchestras and large ensembles
                in the jazz era that led to the mainstream appeal of big band-style swing jazz. This included Fletcher Henderson’s band and the Chicago-based Earl Hines’ Band.
                here was also Duke Ellington’s band in New York, which owned a Cotton Club residency in 1927. The same era witnessed the abundance of musical families, 
                where one of the family members taught the whole family music. </p><br><br>

                <dt><b>1. Improvisation :</b></dt>
                    <dd>Creative freedom is one of the fundamental aspects of jazz music. Each artist has their own unique style.
                    </dd>
                <dt><b>2. Instruments :</b></dt>
                    <dd>
                        Jazz music relies on saxophone, trombone, trumpet, drums, piano, bass, and guitar.
                    </dd>
                <dt><b>3. Call and response :</b></dt>
                    <dd>
                        azz music is filled with call and response patterns, where one voice or instrument answers the other.
                    </dd>
                <dt><b>4. Swing and blues :</b></dt>
                    <dd>
                        Jazz is very rhythmic and relies on swing and blue notes.
                    </dd>
                <dt><b>5. Syncopation :</b></dt>
                    <dd>
                        Jazz artists like to mix up their phrases and surprise their audiences by playing different note durations frequently. This makes jazz music far less boring than other genres that rely on repetition excessively.
