            <p>Rock music is a broad genre of popular music that originated as "rockand roll"
                in the United States in the late 1940s and early 1950s,
                developing into range of different styles from mid -1960s,
                particulary in the U.S.M and the United Kingdom.

            <h2 id="history">History of Rock music</h2><br>
            <p>Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll, rock 'n' roll, or rock n roll) is a genre of popular music that evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s. It originated from African-American music such as jazz, rhythm and blues, boogie-woogie, gospel, jump blues, as well as country music.[4] While rock and roll's formative elements can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s,[6] the genre did not acquire its name until 1954. </p><br>

            <p>According to journalist Greg Kot, "rock and roll" refers to a style of popular music originating in the United States in the 1950s. By the mid-1960s, rock and roll had developed into "the more encompassing international style known as rock music, though the latter also continued to be known in many circles as rock and roll." For the purpose of differentiation, this article deals with the first definition.</p><br>

            <p>In the earliest rock and roll styles, either the piano or saxophone was typically the lead instrument. These instruments were generally replaced or supplemented by guitar in the middle to late 1950s. The beat is essentially a dance rhythm with an accentuated backbeat, almost always provided by a snare drum. Classic rock and roll is usually played with one or two electric guitars (one lead, one rhythm) and a double bass (string bass). After the mid-1950s, electric bass guitars ("Fender bass") and drum kits became popular in classic rock.</p><br>

            <p>Rock and roll had a polarizing influence on lifestyles, fashion, attitudes, and language. It is often portrayed in movies, fan magazines, and on television. Some people believe that the music had a positive influence on the civil rights movement, because both Black American and White American teenagers enjoyed it.</p><br><br>

                <dt><b>The use of electric instruments</b></dt>
                    <dd>Rock music is typically characterized by the use of electric instruments, such as the electric guitar, bass guitar, and drums. These instruments produce a louder, more powerful sound than acoustic instruments, which gives rock music its distinctive energy.

                <dt><b>The use of blues forms</b></dt>
                    <dd>
                        Rock music often borrows from the blues, a genre of African-American music that is characterized by its use of call-and-response vocals, simple chord progressions, and a strong beat.
                    </dd>
                <dt><b>The use of a verse-chorus structure</b></dt>
                    <dd>
                        Rock songs typically follow a verse-chorus structure, which means that the song is divided into two main sections: the verse and the chorus. The verse typically introduces the song's melody and lyrics, while the chorus repeats the main melody and lyrics.
